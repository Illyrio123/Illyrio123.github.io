        let hobby1 = "I have been playing the violin since I was 4 years old, and it's definitely one of my favorite and most longstanding hobbies. I've played in multiple local orchestras, including my high school's orchestra. I now find myself interested in expanding my violin playing into other genres such as jazz and Indian classical music.";
        // Assign text for percussion hobby to string variable
        let hobby2 = "I first got into playing percussion in 5th grade, and I've been in love with it ever since. Over the years, I've developed my improvisation and musicality; I've played in multiple rock bands, concert bands, and jazz groups. Nowadays, I mostly focus on playing jazz, which definitely can challenge both how you think about and play drums.";
        // Assign text for travelling hobby to string variable
        let hobby3 = "Every year, my family and I go on some trip to a place we've never been before. I've seen Shinjuku Station in Japan - the busiest train station in the world - and hiked to the top of the Alps. I love travelling because, everywhere I go, I always learn something new, whether it's about food, architecture, or music. And to top it off, I get to experience those unique environments for myself.";
        // Assign text for art hobby to string variable
        let hobby4 = "Whenever I need to take a break from doing homework or chores, I'll turn to doodling or writing music, or any other type of art. I've always been obssessed with maps and images; I also love art that exhibits powerful emotions, like melancholic or gothic art. I'm currently absorbed in bringing this obsession with drama into my musical compsotions.";
